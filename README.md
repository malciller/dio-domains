High-performance OCaml 5.2 trading engine for Kraken featuring domain-based parallel strategy execution. Each trading asset runs in its own isolated domain with lock-free communication, circuit breaker connection management, and real-time telemetry. Built for high-frequency trading with WebSocket data feeds, asynchronous order execution, and a reactive terminal dashboard.

## Requirements

- OCaml 5.2.0 (opam)
- Kraken API key/secret
- macOS/Linux/WSL

## Quick Start

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/malciller/dio.git
cd dio
opam install . --deps-only
dune build
```

### Configure
Create `.env`:
```bash
KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_kraken_api_key
KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_kraken_api_secret
```

Edit `_config.json` (example):
```json
{
  "logging_level": "info",            // Log verbosity: debug, info, warning, error
  "logging_sections": "",             // Filter logs by section (optional, comma-separated)
  "trading": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTC/USD",            // Pair to trade
      "qty": "0.0002",                // Base asset quantity per order
      "grid_interval": "0.33",        // Distance between buy/sell orders (as price units)
      "sell_mult": "0.999",           // Sell amount multiplier (qty * sell_mult = sell order size)
      "strategy": "Grid"              // Strategy name: "Grid"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "USDG/USD",           // Pair to trade
      "qty": "100.0",                 // Trade size per market making quote
      "min_usd_balance": "500.0",     // Minimum USD balance required to run this strategy. Optional, but required if no max_exposure.
      "max_exposure": "500.0",        // Maximum asset balance allowed before pausing strategy. Optional, but required if no min_usd_balance.
      "strategy": "MM"                // Strategy name: "MM"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Run
```bash
./_build/default/bin/main.exe --dashboard   # with UI
./_build/default/bin/main.exe               # headless
```

## Strategies

- GRID: Maintains buy/sell ladders around price with configurable spacing and size.
- MM (Adaptive Market Maker): Dynamically adapts its quoting style based on market fees—uses a greedy quoting approach for no-fee markets and a conservative, profit-guaranteeing strategy where trading fees apply. Always ensures configured profit margins are met by factoring in fees as necessary.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Based Parallelism**: Each trading asset runs in its own OCaml domain for true parallel execution without GIL limitations
- **Lock-Free Communication**: Event-driven architecture with ring buffers for high-throughput data processing
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Automatic connection management with health monitoring and graceful degradation
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: Comprehensive metrics collection for performance monitoring and debugging
- **High-Frequency Trading**: Optimized for low-latency execution with microsecond-precision timing
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervised domains with automatic restart and exponential backoff
- **Reactive Dashboard**: Real-time terminal UI with live metrics and connection status

## Architecture

- **Main Entry Point**: Command-line interface with dashboard and headless modes, signal handling for graceful shutdown.
- **Domain Spawner**: Manages OCaml domains for parallel strategy execution - each trading asset runs in its own isolated domain with supervision and auto-restart capabilities.
- **Supervisor**: Orchestrates WebSocket connections with circuit breaker patterns, heartbeat monitoring, and connection health management.
- **Engine Core**:
  - **Concurrency**: Lock-free event bus and registry for inter-domain communication.
  - **Config**: Configuration management and validation.
  - **Strategies**: High-frequency trading algorithms (Grid, Adaptive Market Maker) running in parallel domains.
  - **Order Executor**: Asynchronous order placement, amendment, and cancellation with duplicate detection.
  - **Telemetry**: Real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection.
  - **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels and sections.
- **Exchange Integration (Kraken)**:
  - **WebSocket Feeds**: Real-time ticker, orderbook, balance, and execution data with ring buffer storage.
  - **Trading Client**: Authenticated order operations with ping/pong heartbeat monitoring.
  - **Authentication**: Secure token generation and management.
- **Dashboard**: Reactive terminal UI with real-time metrics, connection status, and trading activity monitoring.
