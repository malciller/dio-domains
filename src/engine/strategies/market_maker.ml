(**
  Market making strategy indicated by strategy: "MM" in the configuration.

  This strategy implements a market making system that maintains buy and sell orders
  around the current spread, adjusting order placement based on fee levels and
  maintaining balance limits.

  The strategy generates orders and pushes them to a ringbuffer for execution elsewhere.
